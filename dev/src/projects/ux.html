    %firstparagraph% = In the class Foundations of User Experience my group mates and I designed an app. The app’s purpose is to take a list of ingredients from the user and show them what recipes can be made with what they have on hand. We designed a user flow of the app and created wireframe models for most of the screens. The purpose of the app is to assist busy students in cooking food when they have little supplies, ingredients, time, and skills.
    %secondparagraph% = It was refreshing to brush up on my group work skills. As a senior, I don’t have many projects that are completed as a group other than senior design. This project was a great reminder that planning ahead, designing the layout and user flow can be extremely beneficial for having a sense of direction when developing the project. I often find myself writing the code and creating the user interface before I have fully designed how it should work. This is never a good idea and causes me massive frustration and unnecessary work.
